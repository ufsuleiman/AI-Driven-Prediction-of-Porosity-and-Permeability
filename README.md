Porosity and permeability are fundamental petrophysical properties that control the storage and flow behavior of reservoir rocks. Accurate estimation of these parameters is essential for effective reservoir evaluation, management strategies, and production forecasting. While core analysis remains the most reliable method for determining these properties, it is expensive, labour-intensive, and limited in spatial coverage, making it unsuitable for large-scale or continuous reservoir characterization.

Conventional empirical and statistical models have also shown limitations in capturing the complex, nonlinear relationships inherent in subsurface formations. To overcome these challenges, this study explores an artificial intelligence (AI)–driven approach for predicting porosity and permeability from well log data. Petrophysical logs from well 15/19-F-1B (Statoil Petroleum), spanning a depth interval of 3229.4–3441.9 m, were utilized for the analysis.

Data preprocessing included linear interpolation to resolve missing values and Z-score normalization to achieve uniform feature scaling. A Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) artificial neural network with ReLU activation was developed in Python using the Scikit-Learn library. For porosity prediction, RHOB, NPHI, DT, GR, PEF, CALI, and DRHO were employed as input features, while permeability prediction incorporated these variables along with resistivity logs (RD, RM, RT).

The model demonstrated excellent predictive performance. Porosity estimation achieved an RMSE of 0.0845 and an R² of 0.9925, while permeability prediction yielded an RMSE of 0.0820 and an R² of 0.9901. These results highlight the potential of ANN-based models as efficient, cost-effective, and accurate tools for petrophysical property estimation, offering a robust alternative to traditional methods.
